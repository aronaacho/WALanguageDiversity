    "\n",
    "* ## Research Question 1: How does language diversity in each Washington county affect their educational attainment outcomes?\n",
    "##### &emsp;Language diversity was not found to have as large of an effect on educational attainment across Washington counties as we thought it might have. In fact, for certain non-English language speaking groups, it can be argued that there is an inverse relationship, where counties with more language speakers see lower rates of educational attainment. It seems that the results for each language speaking group is either the previously mentioned case, or there is a very slight correlation between increasing language diversity and educational attainment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ## Research Question 2: How do school district budgets and spending affect spoken language diversity in WA counties?\n",
    "##### &emsp;From our analysis, school district budgets and spending do not seem to have a strong effect on spoken language diversity in WA counties, nor the inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ## Research Question 3: To what extent do Washington residents continue to practice their ancestral culture through language?\n",
    "##### &emsp;Generally, we have found that Washington residents with a diverse ancestral background do not have a constant relationship with the amount of ancestral language is spoken. Rather, in counties with more ancestrally diverse populations, the rate of residents that speak only English increases as well.\n",

    "## **Motivation**\n",
    "***\n",
    "##### &emsp;Spoken language diversity in our communities directly affects the extent to which various cultures can communicate and interact with each other. Identifying the underlying reasons behind why certain Washington counties have larger ranges of spoken languages can allow for the expansion of language diversity in other counties lacking in this aspect to foster closer, more personal, communities. We look at two vital areas in Washington state's primary communities: The academia space and family households. Local governments can use these conclusions to increase efforts and redirect resources in order to increase spoken language diversity in their respective territories."

    "## **Data Setting**\n",
    "***\n",
    "##### &emsp; For this project, we retrieved the majority of our datasets from the United States Census, focusing on data from all 39 Washington counties of the most recent year that was record, with the majority of our data coming from 2022. We used a total of five datasets for this research project, four of which came from the US Census. The one we did not retrieve from the US Census was the dataset containing per pupil expenditure (PPE) values for all school districts in Washington, which was retrieved from the Official Washington State Open Data Portal. For this single dataset, we used the data.wa.gov website's built in aggregation tools to filter out unnecessary data points that were not relevant for our project. This was a solution to the initial issue of the dataset's file size being too large, and also made it easier for us to work with the data once it had been imported. After aggregation, we were left with data for school district names and their PPEs. We used the datasets from the US Census to merge on matching school districts in order to find which counties each district is in, allowing us to find the average PPE value for each Washington county. These datasets allowed us to examine collections of county data in a more granular manner as we were able to merge them with each other in order to create plots showing trends between the shared data values.\n",
    "##### &emsp; As the majority of this data is taken from the US Census Bureau, the population in which is encapsulated is all United States residents, or all Washington State residents in our case, at the time of collection. Much of the data is respondent, meaning that the data is prone to response bias. Overall, the census data is vulnerable to response biases because of the participants succumbing to social desirability which may skew the data to support more socially acceptable answers. Despite this, we believe that some solid takeaways can be formed using the resulting graphs and data plots, and could be further supported or investigated by future research and analysis in this area.\n",

    "##### &emsp; These six graphs are the ouput of the code above. Each of the six graphs has plotted bars in the background representing the enrollment percentage values of undergraduate students in green and postgraduate students in blue for each county. Additionaly for each graph, the percentage of residents who speak the highlighted language or language group is represented by the colored line plot, with one language group per graph. Each graph is sorted by undergraduate enrollment percentages by county, meaning the county with the highest undergraduate enrollment rate is on the right. Let's look at the top four graphs first, looking at speaking rates of each of the four non-English only groups. Starting with spanish speakers, we can clearly see that there is no correlation between spanish speakers and college enrollment in Washington counties, as there are 3-4 large spikes in speaking rates towards the lower end of the college enrollment percentages. This is the only graph out of the first four that has such a strong negative correlation. From this, a conclusion could be made opposite to what we initially hypothesized; that larger spanish speaking and hispanic communities actually have lower college enrollment rates than english only speakers due to these communities historically recieving less economical and societal support. Although, it could be argued that this negative correlation is not relevant as there may be external factors that affect college enrollment rates within communities containing spanish speakers. This graph was the one that suprised us the most, and also became the most thought provoking out of the ones created for the first research question.\n",
    "##### &emsp; Looking at the remaining three graphs, there is a very slight correlation between increasing language speaking rates and college enrollment rates, with the largest being seen in the Asian & Pacific Island Language Speakers graph and the smallest being seen in the Other Language Speakers graph. Although the correlation is minimal, it does help indicate that speaking a language other than english may help contribute towards higher college enrollment rates in Washington counties. However, it is most likely a minimal one of many factors that contribute towards this.\n",
    "##### &emsp; Finally, let's examine the bottom two graphs that contain information those who speak only english, and those who speak a language other than english (a combination of the top four graphs). The majority of conclusions between these two graphs can be shared as they are essentially inverses of each other. One key detail noticed about these graphs is that there is a much higher amplitude in the speaking rates towards the lower end of college enrollment for counties, showing that counties with higher rates of english only speakers tend to have higher enrollment rates as well. Initially, this was suprising, but as we thought about it more, it became a little clearer. We can conclude that  communities with higher rates of english only speakers tend to not house as many minority populations as those with higher language diversity, thus not representing many minority communities. These minority communities are often not supported as well as their white counterparts in society, having harder times pursuing higher education after high school due many reasons such as financial situations, housing, societal restrictions. Although these graphs did not help show that investing in increased language diversity would lead to higher college enrollment rates, it did help further illuminate the issue of struggling minority communities in relation to higher education. As well as their presence in Washington and American society as communities who consitently face increased hardships in comparison to other communities who have historically held more socioeconomic strength."

    "##### &emsp; From this code above, we were able to generate this visualization below. To restate our motive for choosing to use two subplots was to search for any correlations between the amount of PPEs and the language spoken in a county. The PPE for each county was determined by taking the mean PPE of all K-12 school districts in the county. The subplots share the same x-axis of a PPE-ranked list of Washington state counties. To express the various language categories spoken in each county, we separated them by the non-English categories that were reported from our initial dataset: Spanish, Other Indo-European, Asian and Pacific Island, and Other languages. All of this resulted in the first visualization. When we order the counties by PPE, no clear trendline is shown from the tops of the bars. We chose to include the second subplot of the general average PPE by county for transparency and to also examine the slope in the directionality of the PPE averages.\n",
    "##### &emsp; We can see that from the highest PPE in Cowlitz County with around $12,000 to the lower PPE in Ferry County with around $6,500, there is a gradual linear decrease in PPE. Comparatively, the plot above with the languages includes various spikes of Spanish and Other Indo-European languages. Overall there is basic no correlation between these two variables. This poses the question: Should language diversity be a factor in PPE levels? From our results, it certains seems as though they do no have any influence over the expenditure levels, however, with language diversity implying racial diveristy, and with previous knowledge about the intentional survey of people of Hispanic or Latino Origin for civil rights purposes. As fluency in one language does not guarentee fluency in another, and while we also would like to look at a larger sample and English literacy rates by language, we believe that perhaps investing PPE by language diversity could benefit early to adolescent literacy in students in a direction towards higher equity in learning resources."

    "##### &emsp; First, to gauge the diversity of languages at a smaller scale, we chose to group all non-English speaking households together against the exclusively English speaking households. We were intrigued by the variability of the households that spoke English only and thought that the English Only households provided a range that was wide enough that could potentially show us a relationship to the ancestrial background when utilized as a predicted variable. \n",
    "##### &emsp; The scatterplot shows of the rates of English Only speakng households, as determined above, by ancestrial diversity. We can clearly see a postiive and fairly strong linear relationship, indicating that there is some correlation between these two variables. Using the least-ordinary squares table, it shows that the R-squared value is 0.825, meaning that 82.5% of the variability in the English Only households can be attributed to the ancestrial diversity. Also, with the p-value being less than the 5% significance level of 0.000, we can reject the notion that English Only households do not have a correlation with ancestrial diversity. Before running these analyses, we expected the results to have an inverse relationship, as we assumed that more ancestral diversity was an indicator of more non-English languages being used. We were surprised to have found that this was the opposite and to conclude that it is to a low extent that Washington residents continue to practice their ancestral culture through language. When taking on a communicative lens, many times, immigrant families purposefully choose not to teach their children their native tongue in hopes of faster assimulation by picking up English and becoming Americanized. Another reason for this positive correlation could be that when counties facilitate people with diverse ancestrial backgrounds, to communicate with one another, English may have defaulted to be the most universal and accessbile language."

    "## **Impact and Limitations**\n",
    "***\n",
    "##### &emsp; Our greatest informant and limitation was our reliance on the US Census Bureau for reliable data. As 4 out of 5 of the datasets we chose to analyze were obtained from this singular, albeit grand, source, we believe that it is natural that our analysis would extend the same biases and limitations. As mentioned above in the data setting section, generally, census data is prone to response bias, with social desirability bias arguably the most susceptible to the responders as it deals with demographic data. An implication of this can be that responders of certain cultures and demographics that are less recognized in the United States may not have felt the same inclination for declaring their ancestry and language compared to those who are in communities that are actively celebrated. Especially as we look at ancestry in Washington state, we have to recognize that there are communities that had their lineage systemically erased from archives and history, such as the African and Indigenous Americans, and therefore the responders may not be able to report their full ancestral background. We also noticed the lack of AAPI ancestry in our data. With the dataset’s notes stating that “this table lists only the largest ancestry groups…” and that it only recorded the first and second ancestry, we questioned how the US Census defined “largest” and what groups made that “largest” cutoff. While they also redirected to “more detailed tables” for more ancestral groups, we agreed that this was an example of erasure, as it initially conveyed that there were no people of AAPI ancestry in Washington state. \n",
    "##### &emsp; As for our graphs, we recognize that there is skewing of the axes for a closer look at the visualizations, which can lead to unintentional misinformed opinions and understandings. While we did not see a correlation between the per pupil expenditures and the languages spoken in each county, we can see that it is apparent that there is a high proportion of Spanish speakers in comparison to the other non-English languages. This is true for the visualizations showing educational attainment by language and, although it is a loose trend, the counties with the most amount of Spanish speaker seemed to have the least amount of educational attainment. We found trends interesting, as we first thought that language spoken did not have any influence in the ways counties are supported and uplifted, however we urge viewers to think critically about other socioeconomic factors that we failed to highlight in our project that are popular indicators of wellbeing (eg. race, income). We also acknowledge that we were only able to analyze one year’s worth of data, which the reliability of our project. If we were able to invest more time into this project, we envision that we would have been able to produce much more reliable and valid results.  \n"

    "## **Challenge Goals**\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "##### &emsp; As mentioned in the data setting section, we used multiple datasets from the US Census in order to compare trends across Washington counties by connecting location based data, the Washington county, as our primary key. For example, to answer our third research question, we have taken data about the spoken language diversity of Washington counties and also data about county-specific ancestral backgrounds and have merged them together with the county being the main denominator. By using multiple datasets, we were able to achieve higher relationality and diversity in the kinds of data that were analyzed.\n",
    "### **New Libraries:** \n",
    "\n",
    "##### &emsp; We have mainly used Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects from the Plotly library to create interactive visualizations to support the communication of our analyses. We believe that including visualizations that have some form of interactivity with a viewer encourages more direct attention and interpretation. We especially chose to lean into the hover label feature of Plotly, which allows for the viewer to hover over a data point on a visualization and indicate its x and y values without having to physically reference the axis. We found that because we wanted to communicate relationships between features, stacking the plot on top of one another created a sense of relativity, with the hover labels helping to highlight the more granular information, allowing for data to be conveyed more transparently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Messy Data**:\n",
    "##### &emsp; We initially did not believe that we would have to deal with messy data, as our first glance at our datasets seemed to have been stored neatly. We quickly realized that the data from the robust US Census’s interactive interface did not translate as well when reading them as CSVs for analysis. Multi-indexes and column sections and headings were particularly messy, as we had to manually separate them with regex patterns, pivot the tables, and rename the columns to remove non-breaking and white spaces. As we were also using multiple datasets that were from collectors outside of the US Census, we also had to normalize the county and district names to make sure joins and merges of the separate tables were performed correctly without data loss.\n",
    " \n",
    "### **Result Validity**:\n",
    "##### &emsp; After looking at the results of our first visualization from our third research question, we deemed that performing a linear regression on the two variables, ancestral diversity and the number of households that spoke english exclusively, could produce a meaningful output. Although not as major as the other challenge goals, we felt that the inclusion of statistical analysis to answer this question helped strengthen our overall understanding of the relationships about language diversity within Washington state. \n"

    "##### &emsp; Our proposed work plan time estimates were relatively accurate. Our estimates were close to reality for the most part as we were able judge based on previous experience in working with datasets and visualizations from class assignments in CSE 163. The two areas that took longer than anticipated were cleaning the data and creating the visualizations. Since we initially did not anticipate having to clean the data much, we estimated a lower amount of time spent on this step. However, as mentioned previously, the datasets ended up being quite messy and required a lengthy amount of cleaning code and time. For creating the visualizations, we took longer than expected since we had not gotten much experience using Plotly as it was a new library from the one(s) using during class assignments. Other than these two areas, we were able to follow our proposed plan fairly accurately and spent a fair amount of time on each step of this research project.\n",
