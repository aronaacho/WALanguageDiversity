    "***\n",
    "##### &emsp;Spoken language diversity in our communities directly affects the extent to which various cultures can communicate and interact with each other. Identifying the underlying reasons behind why certain Washington counties have larger ranges of spoken languages can allow for the expansion of language diversity in other counties lacking in this aspect. Local governments can use these conclusions to increase efforts and redirect resources in order to increase spoken language diversity in their respective territories."

    "##### &emsp;We plan on using Washington focused datasets from the United States Census. The main datasets we will be using will be a collection of county data, which will allow us to analyze data in a more granular manner. This attention to detail is needed in identifying the various specific languages being spoken in the state, instead of overarching language groups. As this data is taken from the United States Census Bureau, the population in which is encapsulated is all United States residents at the time of collection. Much of the data is respondent, meaning that the data is prone to response bias. Overall, census data is vulnerable to response biases because of participants succumbing to social desirability which may skew the data to support more socially acceptable answers. "

We believe that using interactive visualizations will make our project more robust and transparent, and would be an ideal method to making sure data points are not being over-generalized into larger categories, as we are expecting to create a project that includes more granular information, hence why we are choosing to focus in on the counties in one state rather than the whole country.\n",
